## ‚≠ê How to make a pull request 

There are some steps that you need to follow before making any contribution in this project, the following steps are important to get start.


* Step 1: [Fork](https://github.com/sabhisharma-ise/BlockLearn/fork) the repo first

* Step 2: Go to your Git terminal and clone it on your machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/BlockLearn.git
    ```
* Step 3: Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/sabhisharma-ise/BlockLearn.git
    ```
* Step 4: Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main
    ```
* Step 5: Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>

     # Track the changes
     git status

     git add . or git add <file_name>
     ```
* Step 7: Commit your changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningful but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 8: Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```
